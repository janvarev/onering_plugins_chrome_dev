## Setup

1. Install **separate Chrome**, that will be controlled by plugins to get translation. For example, you can use this portable version: https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google-chrome-portable-64 
2. Run it in dev mode. You can download `chrome_dev_controlled.bat` file and change EXE filename inside to your Chrome EXE file; 
or use cmd like `GoogleChromePortable.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-allow-origins=*`
3. Now you get Chrome example that can be controlled by external plugin

1. Copy plugin to your OneRingTranslator plugin folder
2. Run OneRingTranslator in usual style. Plugin must send translation phrases to controlled Chrome, and get results back.
